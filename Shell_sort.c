//Cormen lesson 1 : Shell sort working
//Shell sort is a variation of insertion sort: Complexity is still n-squared
//Good Explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J14Pbw_XnY by sedgewick
//In insertion sort, we move elements only one position ahead. When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are involved.
//The idea of shellSort is to allow exchange of far items. In shellSort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h. 
//We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1. An array is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every hâ€™th element is sorted.
//Time complexity of above implementation of shellsort is O(n2). In the above implementation gap is reduce by half in every iteration. 
//There are many other ways to reduce gap which lead to better time complexity. example 3x+1 O(n^3/2) proposed by knuth
