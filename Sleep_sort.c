//Cormen lesson 1 : C implementation of Sleep Sort
//This algorithm wonâ€™t work for negative numbers as a thread cannot sleep for a negative amount of time.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>
#include <process.h>

// This is the instruction set of a thread. So in these threads, we "sleep" for a particular amount of time and then when it wakes up the number is printed out
void routine(void *a)
{
    int n = *(int *) a; // typecasting from void to int

    // Sleeping time is proportional to the number. More precisely this thread sleep for 'n' milliseconds
    Sleep(n);

    // After the sleep, print the number
    printf("%d ", n);
}

/* A function that performs sleep sort

_beginthread() is a C run-time library call that creates a new 'thread' for all the integers in the array and returns that thread.

Each of the 'thread' sleeps for a time proportional to that integer and print it after waking.

We pass three parameters to _beginthread :-

1) start_address --> start address of the routine/function which creates a new thread
2) stack_size --> Stack Size of the new thread (which is 0)
3) arglist --> Address of the argument to be passed

The return value of _beginthread() function is a handle to the thread which is created. So we must accept is using the datatype-
'HANDLE' which is included in windows.h header
'HANDLE' datatype is used to represent an event/thread/process etc

So 'HANDLE' datatype is used to define a thread
We store the threads in an array - threads[] which is declared
using 'HANDLE' datatype.

WaitForMultipleObjects() is a function that processes the threads and has four arguments-

1) no_of_threads --> Number of threads to be processed
2) array_of_threads --> This is the array of threads which should be
                        processed. This array must be of the type
                        'HANDLE'
3) TRUE or FALSE --> We pass TRUE if we want all the threads in the
                     array to be processed
4) time_limit --> The threads will be processed until this time limit
                  is crossed. So if we pass a 0 then no threads will
                  be processed, otherwise if we pass an INFINITE, then
                  the program will stop only when all the threads
                  are processed. We can put a cap on the execution
                  time of the program by passing the desired time
                  limit */

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        threads[i] = (HANDLE)_beginthread(&routine, 0,  &arr[i]);
